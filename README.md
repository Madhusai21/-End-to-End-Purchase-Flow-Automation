ðŸš€ Project Showcase: End-to-End Purchase Flow Automation using Selenium and POM
I recently completed an automation project using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and Pytest to automate the complete purchase flow of an e-commerce platform (Demoblaze).

This project was developed using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

#Key features automated:

ðŸ”¹ User Authentication: Automated both Sign-up and Login functionalities.

ðŸ”¹ Product Workflow: Automated product browsing, selection, and adding items to the cart.

ðŸ”¹ Checkout Process: Automated the entire purchase and order placement flow, including filling out checkout and payment details.


#This project helped me strengthen my skills in test automation frameworks, object-oriented design, and real-world test scenario handling.
